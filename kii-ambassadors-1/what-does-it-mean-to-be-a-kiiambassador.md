# What does it mean to be a KiiAmbassador?

Welcome to the KiiAmbassadors Program, our exclusive initiative to spotlight and reward the most committed voices in the KiiChain community.

This is not just a title â€” it's a role of influence and responsibility, for those who believe in our vision and want to help us grow the project both on-chain and online.

You can apply to join the Ambassadors Program through the official KiiChain Discord: [https://discord.gg/kiichain](https://discord.gg/kiichain)

KiiAmbassadors are selected community members who:

* Amplify our core messages on Twitter and other platforms.
* Stay active and helpful in Discord.
* Help bring new users to the chain and nurture the community spirit.
* Represent the KiiChain brand publicly, respectfully and consistently.
