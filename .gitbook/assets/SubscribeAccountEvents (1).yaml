      # It's important to document the events as they are part of the API contract
      # However, defining the schema for each individual event within the OpenAPI
      # specification can be complex and might be better handled in separate 
      # documentation or a more specialized API description format.
      # Here, I'll provide a simplified example of how you might include event 
      # information, but you should consider a more robust approach for 
      # complex event structures.

      # Example of documenting one event (AccountPositionEvent)
      # You would repeat this for all other events.
      # x-events: # A custom extension to hold event definitions
      #   AccountPositionEvent:
      #     type: object
      #     properties:
      #       OMSId:
      #         type: integer
      #       AccountId:
      #         type: integer
      #       # ... (other properties of AccountPositionEvent)
      #     example:
      #       OMSId: 4
      #       AccountId: 4
      #       # ... (example values for other properties)
