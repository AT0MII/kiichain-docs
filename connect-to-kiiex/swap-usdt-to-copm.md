**Step by step**

1.  To be able to swap, you first need to have funds, and you can get them in two ways:

    1. The first one is creating a Deposit.
    2. The second one is getting credit. To do so, you need to contact our support team.

    To create a deposit ticket, navigate to Deposit and use the QR or wallet address to deposit any cryptocurrency.
