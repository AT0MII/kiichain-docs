# The Trading Day

Most KIIEX installations operate 24-hour computer-based trading venues. The trading day runs from UTC Midnight to UTC Midnight (essentially, London time, but without any summertime offset), regardless of the nominal location of the venue. Values such as open or close are those values as of UTC Midnight. Values for day, month, or annual periods run from UTC Midnight to UTC Midnight.
