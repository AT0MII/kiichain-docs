# Use Cases

### Stablecoin FX powerhouse

Traditional FX operations are hindered by TradeFi banking hours (often times 8am to 1pm local). Essentially, only 25% of the day, on business banking days, can businesses or users engage in FX operations. Users can now engage in compliant, fast and affordable FX transactions on KiiChain and receive their funds real-time.&#x20;

### Unified Liquidity for Trading and Payments&#x20;

Liquidity is often fragmented among several different blockchain ecosystems. This causes headaches for users who need to manage different balances and wallets among different ecosystems. Direct bridging from each network can be slow, costly and difficult for users who donâ€™t understand web3 architecture. KiiChain partners with protocols to create an interoperable liquidity layer that can deliver seamless cross-chain experiences to users of all types.&#x20;

### Tokenization of Commodities (RWA)

Commodities are among the most valuable and traded goods in the world with major reserves being mined and developed in emerging countries. Local companies can now tokenize their commodities and contracts, pricing them in Kii or a native asset to their project, and create instant liquidity on a global scale.&#x20;

### Tokenization of Products (RWA)

Imported and exported goods are one of the major drivers of GDP within Latin America and emerging economies. Many multinational companies in the region struggle to process funds and manage liquidity reserves. These products can be tokenized and transacted on the blockchain for users to transact with these goods, and for companies to better manage their reserves.&#x20;

### Tokenization of Real Estate (RWA)

Asset fractionalization and ownership is becoming more imperative than ever before in markets with wealth fragmentation, high inflation and high interest rates. Real estate and asset infrastructure fractionalization allows users to own yield bearing, inflation protected, assets that cannot be owned by these users in whole. By democratizing the ownership process, liquidity can extend to other markets and users who would not otherwise have access prior.&#x20;

### Tokenization of Debt and Equities (RWA)

Public equities, debt instruments, or exchange traded funds that are trading on traditional exchanges can be tokenized to expand, democratize and fractionalize their access cross-border, to individuals who do not have access to these opportunities.&#x20;

### DeFi Lending and Borrowing for Open Credit System&#x20;

Credit is a huge issue in developing countries with strict underwriting standards, toxic level interest rates and lack of available capital. DeFi lending will provide secure ways for users in developed countries to extend safe credit terms to participants in emerging markets.&#x20;

### Payment Finance&#x20;

Businesses and users in developing countries lack formal communication with payment processors abroad. Payment finance is a model that allows local businesses to bring their economic activity on-chain and receive financing that supports their core businesses, primary payment services activities.&#x20;

### Credit Finance

Emerging markets suffer from a multi-trillion dollar credit gap. When businesses can bring their economic activity on-chain, they open themselves up to the world of lending and competitive interest rates. Businesses or users who could not previously receive credit from local institutions, can now communicate with lenders abroad.

### Spot and Forward Settlement&#x20;

The B2B remittance market transacts over hundreds of billions USD annually. These importers and exporters either win or lose on spot or forward contract settlements. By each counterparty posting liquidity via a smart contract on the blockchain, users can eliminate losses by sharing in any FX swings.
