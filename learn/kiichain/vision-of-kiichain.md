# Vision of KiiChain

### Why KII?

While the cryptocurrency space is saturated with a myriad of options, Kii Global distinguishes itself through its profound commitment to societal betterment. Beyond the technical marvels and financial prospects, KiiChain’s ethos is rooted in fostering an accessible, and inclusive financial landscape, especially for the Latino community.&#x20;

Currently, 50% of citizens in developing countries are unbanked, or underbanked. The main reason: their income isn’t sufficient enough to pay for the monthly costs associated with traditional financial services. As a result, these users, and many small businesses associated, lack access to basic financial services and credit lines.&#x20;

As the world rapidly pivots to a decentralized financial paradigm, Kii Global envisions itself at the forefront - not merely as a passive participant but as an active change-maker. By continually iterating on its offerings, forging meaningful partnerships, and staying attuned to the real-world needs of its users, Kii Global is not just building a blockchain; it's crafting the future of finance by combining zero-fixed cost solutions with problem-solving web3 applications.&#x20;

At the heart of it all, Kii Global is more than just a blockchain company. It's a beacon of hope, a promise of a brighter financial future, and a testament to what's possible when innovation meets empathy. Our main goal: create a systemic shift in the middle class in emerging markets.&#x20;
