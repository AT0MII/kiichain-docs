# The Problems We Solve

### **Tokenization of RWA for** Interoperability

Emerging markets historically suffer from high inflation, high interest rates, and less access to institutional lending. Tokenization of RWA is focused on solving traditional and emerging use cases:

1. Accessibility via Fractional Ownership: Emerging markets often lack the infrastructure for widespread investment opportunities. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy small portions of high-value assets. This makes investing accessible to a broader range of individuals who may not have the capital to buy entire assets.
2. Liquidity: Traditional real estate and other asset investments in emerging markets can be illiquid, with long holding periods. Tokenization allows for easier trading of these assets on secondary markets, enhancing liquidity and increasing yield from said assets.
3. Asset Fractionalization: In emerging markets where large assets such as real estate or infrastructure projects are typically owned by the wealthy. Tokenization enables these assets to be divided into smaller, more manageable units that can democratize access and stimulate economic growth by broadening ownership to individuals who cannot afford to purchase an entire asset or property.
4. Lower Costs: Exportation of commodities suffer from saturated Intermediaries that leave the producers with low margins. Tokenization can streamline the purchase and/or investment process, reducing transaction and trade costs.
5. Global Access: tokenized assets can be traded globally, allowing investors from anywhere in the world to participate in emerging market opportunities. RWA dApps seek access to Latin America markets but don't have the resources to bridge to reputable parties in the region.
6. Transparency: tokenizing assets on the public ledger can help mitigate certain risks around unclaimed or disputed land.
7. Compliance and Regulation: Tokenization platforms can integrate compliance mechanisms directly into smart contracts, ensuring that transactions adhere to relevant regulations, and protect investor rights.

### **Access to Institutional Liquidity & Credit**

50% of individuals in emerging markets are underbanked and have extremely limited access to credit terms. The other 50% struggle with high banking costs and interest rates. Kii Global layer 1 with infrastructure for DeFi lending options mixed with the liquidity settlements of its centralized exchange is solving these problems.

Through bridging the capital disparities between developed and emerging economies, the Kii ecosystem will support a wide range of DeFi lending protocols tailored for emerging markets in parallel with KIIEX’s open liquidity to centralized applications.

### **Gas Fee Scalability for Micro-Payments**

Scaling issues exist in current blockchain infrastructure because the amount of transactions processed in seconds is limited to total processing power. For example, Ethereum 2.0 can process roughly 30 transactions per second, therefore, it has to rely on sharding and rollups to scale horizontally and keep transactions flowing at minimal costs. High gas fees on Ethereum ($5 - $20 USD nominal) have prevented wide scale adoption among emerging markets. The majority of adoption thus far has been driven to more low cost gas networks like Tron. However, these networks are becoming more and more congested and the need for a more robust, structured decentralized solution is evident.

Cosmos’ CometBFT can process roughly 10,000 transactions per second and is predesigned within the Inter-Blockchain Communication Pool (IBC). IBC works in conjunction with other layer 1s in the cosmos community to process transactions and keep gas fees minimal, forever.

### **User Friendly Tokenization**

Cosmos based blockchains are built to deploy smart contracts written in Rust and deployed via CosmWasm. Although Rust is an advanced language of code with its benefits, there is a lack of real world developers who understand Rust, and companies who are looking to deploy their contracts with that language.

KiiChain has coded in the popular Solidity language for building and launching smart contracts, making KiiChain EVM compatible. Users can easily deploy their smart contracts, already written in Solidity, into the KiiChain. Kii Global has built an in-house dedicated team to help deploy user’s smart contracts within the blockchain. Companies looking for assistance on how to build smart contracts can rely on Kii Global developers for support and assistance when writing and deploying code.

### **The Best Cash Settlements in Latin America (LatAm)**

Mainstream remittance and payment providers, tethered to archaic banking systems like ACH and SWIFT, grapple with inefficiencies, tardiness and inflated costs. Their modern counterparts, built on decentralized ledger tech, often falter at the “last mile”, rendering their P2P solutions uneconomical.

Kii Global ecosystem offers a much better on-ramp and off-ramp than any other provider in LatAm. Typical on and off-ramp services have limits, delays, and generally are not a reliable way to onboard into crypto or to off-ramp into fiat. KIIEX is able to utilize the local financial infrastructure, because they have built relationships with the local banks, which makes their services low cost, reliable, and without long delays. A spotlight feature of the exchange is its emphasis on "last mile delivery," addressing the importance of deep liquidity pairs against local fiat and the efficient verticalization of its on/off ramp rails for less than 1% cost. This infrastructure helps onboard more web2 users into web3.

### **An Equitable Ecosystem Built for Latam**

The Kii token and KiiChain gives a chance for Latam locals to participate in an ecosystem built just for them, and one they can own a piece of. Users can earn a return on their KII by staking it through validator nodes, and rewards are replenished with 5% of Kii Global cash flow. This gives every Latam person an opportunity to take part of a community and a company with a vision of equitable justice for all.

### **A Compliant Ecosystem**

KII is not at risk of clashing with the local government and banks, because the KII team has done the hard work of educating and building relationships with top banks and government officials in Latam. While most traditional financial institutions have a stigma as well as a lack of knowledge about crypto, KII is paving the way by building the infrastructure needed to offer frictionless cash settlement services. The KII team is a shining example of what right looks like, when it comes to compliance.
