# Economics

There are three type of important network participants in Kiichain.

1. MasterNodes: Kii Global will run its own proprietary validators for its corporate partners. Users who commit 150,000 KII as a minimum to these validators will receive the highest tear of rewards compensation.&#x20;
2. Validators (full nodes): Validators are the heart of Kiichain that build the blocks and approve transactions. The higher amount of KII staked in the validators, the higher percentage of rewards earned from the rewards pool during each epoch.&#x20;
3. Delegators (stakers): Individuals who commit KII to validators in order to participate in staking and earn rewards.&#x20;
