# What is a validator?

### What is a Kii validator? <a href="#what-is-a-cosmos-validator" id="what-is-a-cosmos-validator"></a>

KiiChain is a Cosmos-based blockchain powered by CometBFT that relies on a set of validators to secure the network. The role of validators is to run a full node and participate in consensus by broadcasting votes that contain cryptographic signatures signed by the validator's private key. Validators commit new blocks in the blockchain and receive revenue in exchange for their work. Validators must also participate in governance by voting on proposals. Validators are weighted according to their total stake.

**Validator minimum:** 10,000 KII

### What is a full node? <a href="#what-is-a-full-node" id="what-is-a-full-node"></a>

A full node is a server running a chain's _binary_ (its software) that fully validates transactions and blocks of a blockchain and keeps a full record of all historic activity. A full node is distinct from a pruned node that processes only block headers and a small subset of transactions. Running a full node requires more resources than a pruned node. Validators can decide to run either a full node or a pruned node, but they need to make sure they retain enough blocks to be able to validate new blocks.

Of course, it is possible and encouraged for users to run full nodes even if they do not plan to be validators.
