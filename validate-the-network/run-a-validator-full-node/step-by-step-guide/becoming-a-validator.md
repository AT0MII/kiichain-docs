# Becoming a Validator

The configuration followed before, set your node as a **full node**, this page will guide you to upgrade your node into a validator. &#x20;

## Becoming a validator

Validators are mainly responsible&#x20;

* **The build must be done on top of the upgrade tag (E.g. v1.0.1, v2.0.0)**
* Check the section [Binary Installation](becoming-a-validator.md#binary-installation) on how to do it

Make sure that the binary has the correct version with:

```
kiichaind version
```

To add a new upgrade you must run the following command on Cosmovisor:

```
cosmovisor add-upgrade <upgrade-name> <path-to-binary>
```

Where:

* `<upgrade-name>` is the on-chain upgrade name
* `<path-to-binary>` is the full path for the binary

Example:

```
cosmovisor add-upgrade 1.3.0 /home/ubuntu/kiichain/build/kiichaind
```

&#x20;validating and committing blocks. The main advantages of becoming a validator are:

* **Fees.** Each transaction has fees, and validators are the main entry points of fee distribution. And due to his help on decentralization, part of the fee is exclusive for validators.

## Creating a validator

1. **Key creation**

To create a validator, you first must have a key available for transactions. A new key can be created with:

```bash
kiichaind keys add $VALIDATOR_KEY_NAME
```

You will get an output such as:

```
- name: asd
  type: local
  address: kii1507zhg2k7al477zqarzru7n4566lvcp9xnsxll
  evm_address: ""
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"Ak5kTpx4OIzXYWAOPjEVNFnn/9O+6BUgSbYCYpnUpRU5"}'
  mnemonic: ""

**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

```

2. **Transfer funds**

Ensure your account has sufficient funds for fees and self-delegation.

3. **Create the validator**

A validator will be created based on your consensus public key. You can check your current public key using:

```bash
kiichaind tendermint show-validator
```

To create a validator, first you will need to create a JSON with your validator information.

This template can be used when creating the validator:

```json
{
    "pubkey": {"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey","key":"C2xVqc+u101PQShdTJxGOF2HFCtYWwMDYLl4r2swiGE="},
    "amount": "1000000000000000000000akii",
    "moniker": "MY VALIDATOR",
    "identity": "optional identity signature (ex. UPort or Keybase)",
    "website": "validator's (optional) website",
    "security": "validator's (optional) security contact email",
    "details": "validator's (optional) details",
    "commission-rate": "0.1",
    "commission-max-rate": "0.2",
    "commission-max-change-rate": "0.01",
    "min-self-delegation": "1"
}
```

Where:

* `pubkey` : Validator's public key used for signing blocks (ed25519).&#x20;
* `amount`: Amount of tokens to self-delegate (e.g., 1000 akii with 18 decimals).
* `moniker`: Validator's display name.
* `identity` (optional): Identity string (e.g., Keybase or UPort for verification).
* `website` (optional): Validatorâ€™s website URL.
* `security` (optional): Security contact email for incident disclosure.
* `details` (optional): Additional description of the validator.
* **`commission-rate`** :Initial commission rate (e.g., 0.1 = 10%).
* **`commission-max-rate`**: Maximum commission rate allowed (e.g., 20%).
* **`commission-max-change-rate`**: Max daily change in commission (e.g., 1%).
* `min-self-delegation`: Minimum tokens validator must always self-delegate to stay active.

To apply, you can use the following command:

```bash
# Basic chain information
CHAIN_ID="oro_1336-1"
VALIDATOR_KEY_NAME=<my-validator-key>

# Apply the create validator transaction
kiichaind tx staking create-validator /
  ./validator.json /
  --chain-id=$CHAIN_ID /
  --gas="auto" /
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 /
  --gas-prices="1000000000akii" /
  --from=$VALIDATOR_KEY_NAME
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The transaction must be done on the machine running the node

* An additional flag `--node` can be passed to point to an available RPC node
{% endhint %}
