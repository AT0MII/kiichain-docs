# Choosing a validator

In order to choose their validators, delegators have access to a range of information directly in the Kii block explorer, where all the validators in the active set will be shown.&#x20;

* **Validator's moniker:** Name of the validator candidate.
* **Validator's description**: Description provided by the validator operator.
* **Validator's website**: Link to the validator's website.
* **Initial commission rate**: The commission rate on revenue charged to any delegator by the validator (see below for more detail).
* **Commission max change rate**: The maximum daily increase of the validator's commission. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator.
* **Maximum commission**: The maximum commission rate this validator candidate can charge. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator.
* **Validator self-bond amount**: A validator with a high amount of self-delegated KIIs has more skin-in-the-game than a validator with a low amount.
