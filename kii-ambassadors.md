# Kii Ambassadors

### What does it mean to become a KiiAmbassador?&#x20;

Welcome to the KiiAmbassadors Program, our exclusive initiative to spotlight and reward the most committed voices in the KiiChain community.

This is not just a title — it's a role of influence and responsibility, for those who believe in our vision and want to help us grow the project both on-chain and online.

_All information, tasks, and rewards are shared through the **Private Ambassadors Channel** on our official Discord_.&#x20;

You can apply to join the Ambassadors Program through the official KiiChain Discord (Official Links Channel): [https://discord.gg/kiichain](https://discord.gg/kiichain)

#### KiiAmbassadors are selected community members who:

* Amplify our core messages on Twitter and other platforms.
* Stay active and helpful in Discord.
* Help bring new users to the chain and nurture the community spirit.
* Represent the KiiChain brand publicly, respectfully and consistently.

### To be accepted into the program, you must:

* Have a good follower base and engagement level on social media.
* Follow KiiChain on X and be registered on the ORO Testnet.

### Your core responsibilities

**To maintain your role, we expect:**

* Engage weekly in the Kii Discord, especially in public channels.
* React, share, and comment on KiiChain’s official posts on X.
* Participate in the weekly tasks, shared in the Ambassadors Channel.
* Help grow the community by inviting new users or explaining Kii to newcomers.
* Suggest strong candidates who could join the program in the future.

### Participation perks

Ambassadors who complete tasks consistently and with high quality may receive:

* Rewards in $ORO and $KII.
* Monthly raffles for top ambassadors with USDT prizes.
* Shoutouts on our official socials and Discord.
* Access to exclusive giveaways.
* Special Q\&A sessions with the KiiChain Core Team.
* Early access to new features, tools, and campaigns.

### Points system and performance

To ensure fairness and reward real contribution, we have created a Points System to track all ambassador activities. Each action, such as retweeting, commenting, participating in Discord, creating original content, or attending events, will earn you points.

At the end of each month, top-performing ambassadors will be rewarded based on their accumulated points.

**Our mod team will also share a weekly form where you can submit proof of your participation and activities, ensuring your points are correctly assigned.**

In the table below, you can see how the points system is structured.

### Rewards

#### Monthly Reward

* **2,000 USDT in Rewards for the Top Contributors of the Month.** Climb the leaderboard and secure your reward.
* Every active ambassador is eligible to receive $300 USD worth of $KII per month, subject to the following conditions:
  * Publish at least 1 original post per week (e.g., thread, infographic, video).
  * Engage (like, retweet, and comment) with every official Kii post shared in the ambassador group.
  * Be active in public Discord channels with at least 3 helpful messages per week.
  * Complete and submit weekly tasks through our tracking system

&#x20;       _Rewards are vested with a 3-month cliff followed by 18-month linear vesting, and are based on a $100M fully diluted valuation (FDV) for $KII._

### Ambassador Incentives & Referral-Based Role System

The KiiAmbassadors program rewards not only consistency and engagement, but also your ability to grow the community by bringing in other qualified contributors.

We’ve created a referral-based role progression system, designed to reward ambassadors who actively expand the program with high-quality participants.

#### Role Progression Based on Referrals

For every 3 new KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) you refer who are accepted into the program, your role is upgraded and you receive a bonus of $200 USD worth of $KII. This structure incentivizes high-quality referrals and gives ambassadors recognition as they grow the program. All bonuses follow the same vesting schedule as the base incentive (3-month cliff, 18-month linear vesting).

To remain active in the program, ambassadors are also required to publish at least 4 pieces of original content per month.

How to Qualify a Referral

To count as a valid referral:

* The referred KOL must follow KiiChain on X.
* They must join and be approved into the official Ambassador Discord server.
* The referral must be reported and verified by the Kii team.

### How to lose the role

We reserve the right to revoke the role if:

* You spread FUD or attack the KiiChain project or team.
* You share scam links or break Discord’s rules.
* You leak confidential information or early announcements.
* You remain inactive without justification for a prolonged period.
* You repeatedly ignore or skip assigned tasks.

### Evaluation process

Every 30 days, the KiiChain team will evaluate ambassador activity based on:

* Task completion
* Quality of participation
* Alignment with community values

Members who don’t meet the standards may be removed from the program to make room for new voices.

This program will evolve over time with new challenges, perks and surprises. Stay active, stay curious, and keep pushing KiiChain to new frontiers.
