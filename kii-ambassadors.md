# Kii Ambassadors

### What does it mean to become a KiiAmbassador?&#x20;

Welcome to the KiiAmbassadors Program, our exclusive initiative to spotlight and reward the most committed voices in the KiiChain community.

This is not just a title — it's a role of influence and responsibility, for those who believe in our vision and want to help us grow the project both on-chain and online.

You can apply to join the Ambassadors Program through the official KiiChain Discord: [https://discord.gg/kiichain](https://discord.gg/kiichain)

KiiAmbassadors are selected community members who:

* Amplify our core messages on Twitter and other platforms.
* Stay active and helpful in Discord.
* Help bring new users to the chain and nurture the community spirit.
* Represent the KiiChain brand publicly, respectfully and consistently.

### Your core responsibilities

To maintain your role, we expect:

* Engage weekly in the Kii Discord, especially in public channels.
* React, share, and comment on KiiChain’s official posts on Twitter.
* Participate in the weekly tasks, shared in this channel.
* Help grow the community by inviting new users or explaining Kii to newcomers.
* Report scams or malicious behavior to the mod team.
* Suggest strong candidates who could join the program in the future.

### Participation perks

Ambassadors who complete tasks consistently and with high quality may receive:

* XP for the airdrop, redeemable for $KII at Mainnet launch
* Monthly raffle for top ambassadors with prizes in USDT
* GigaAmbassador role, which grants an airdrop multiplier
* Shoutouts on our official socials and Discord
* Access to exclusive giveaways
* Special Q\&A sessions with the KiiChain Core Team
* Early access to new features, tools, and campaigns
* Promotional content kits (logos, graphics, memes, templates)

### Points system and performance

To ensure fairness and reward real contribution, we have created a Points System to track all ambassador activities. Each action, such as retweeting, commenting, participating in Discord, creating original content, or attending events, will earn you points.

At the end of each month, top-performing ambassadors will be rewarded based on their accumulated points.

**Our mod team will also share a weekly form where you can submit proof of your participation and activities, ensuring your points are correctly assigned.**

In the table below, you can see how the points system is structured.

### How to lose the role

We reserve the right to revoke the role if:

* You spread FUD or attack the KiiChain project or team.
* You share scam links or break Discord’s rules.
* You leak confidential information or early announcements.
* You remain inactive without justification for a prolonged period.
* You repeatedly ignore or skip assigned tasks.

### Evaluation process

Every 30 days, the KiiChain team will evaluate ambassador activity based on:

* Task completion
* Quality of participation
* Alignment with community values

Members who don’t meet the standards may be removed from the program to make room for new voices.

This program will evolve over time with new challenges, perks and surprises. Stay active, stay curious, and keep pushing KiiChain to new frontiers.
