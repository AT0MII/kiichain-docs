# JS/TS SDK

**Note: This project is still under development so future changes will be made.**&#x20;

## Kiijs-SDK

KiiJS is a monorepo that contains multiple NPM libraries for writing applications that interact with KiiChain. Apart from the built SDK, the chain matches a lot of operability from cosmjs.

### Documentation

Each package has it's own documentation under its readme file.

### Packages

KiiJS consists of smaller NPM packages within the @kiichain namespace. For more detailed documentation on each package, please refer to the table below.
