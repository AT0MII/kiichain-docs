# Set Up KIIEX Account

1. Set up your account at [Kiiex Signup](https://exchange.kiiex.io/signup) or login to an existing account at [Kiiex Login](https://exchange.kiiex.io/login).
2. When setting up your account, it is important to confirm your email before logging in for the first time.&#x20;

3. Once you've created your account and logged in successfully, you need to complete KYC by clicking your account profile in the top right corner -> settings -> Verification Level.&#x20;

Click "Increase to Level 1" and have a government-issued ID ready before you start. Make sure your photos are clear and eligible before you submit the required documents/photos.  Please wait 1 minute and let the system verify your identity before you try again.&#x20;

4. Secure your account with 2FA by going to your profile in the top right -> Settings -> Profile & Security -> Two-Factor Authentication.

We recommend using Google Authentication to secure your account. Never share your codes with anyone. KIIEX will never ask you for your password or 2FA codes.&#x20;
