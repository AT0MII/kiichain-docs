# Evaluation Process

Every 30 days, the KiiChain team will evaluate ambassador activity based on:

* Task completion
* Quality of participation
* Alignment with community values

Members who donâ€™t meet the standards may be removed from the program to make room for new voices.

This program will evolve over time with new challenges, perks and surprises. Stay active, stay curious, and keep pushing KiiChain to new frontiers.
