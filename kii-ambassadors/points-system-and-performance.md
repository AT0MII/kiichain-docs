# Points System & Performance

To ensure fairness and reward real contribution, we have created a Points System to track all ambassador activities. Each action, such as retweeting, commenting, participating in Discord, creating original content, or attending events, will earn you points.

At the end of each month, top-performing ambassadors will be rewarded based on their accumulated points.

**Our mod team will also share a weekly form where you can submit proof of your participation and activities, ensuring your points are correctly assigned.**

In the table below, you can see how the points system is structured.
